1. Folder Structure (The "Drawer" System)

    data.model: For the "Blueprints" of your app.

        ClosetAttributes.kt (Enums: Category, Season, Color, Visibility)

        Item.kt, Outfit.kt, Closet.kt (The Data Classes)

    util: For "General Tools" (Date formatters, Internet checkers).

2. The "Bridge" Strategy

    Enum -> Firebase: Use .name (e.g., Visibility.PUBLIC.name saves as "PUBLIC").

    Firebase -> Enum: Use the String.toVisibility() extension function with try-catch.

    Enum -> Screen: Use an override fun toString() inside the Enum to make it look pretty (e.g., "FRIENDS_ONLY" becomes "Friends Only").

3. Selection Logic (Dependent Dropdowns)

    User picks a Main Category (Tops).

    App uses the Enum list to instantly filter and update the Sub-Category dropdown.

    Always clear the sub-category (setText("")) if the main category is changed.


// Optional: Makes the UI look nice ---- in enum class for visibility
    override fun toString(): String = name.lowercase().replaceFirstChar { it.uppercase() }
